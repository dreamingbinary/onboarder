# onboarder
Collection of custom scripts to enable faster onboarding of users to various systems.

Idea is to link to this as submodule.
Each company would use their own <system.onboard.txt> and <system.offboard.txt> file. Serves as source of truth / audit trail.
Commit these files.
Github Workflow runs and onboards or offboards accordingly.
